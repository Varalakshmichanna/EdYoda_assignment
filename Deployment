steps:
1. Open the Deployment YAML file to update
2. First, increase the number of replicas to ensure there is more than one instance running and give new image name.

	apiVersion: apps/v1
	kind: Deployment
	metadata:
  	  name: my-deployment
	spec:
  	  replicas: 2
          template:
    	     spec:
               containers:
      		- name: my-container
        	  image: my-new-image:latest

3. Use the kubectl apply command to apply the updated deployment configuration.

   -->kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml

4. Check the status of the deployment to ensure the new pods are being created and the old ones are being terminated.

   -->kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment

5. Once the rollout is complete, verify that the new image is running

   -->kubectl get pods -l app=my-deployment

6. If something went wrong roll back to previous version
