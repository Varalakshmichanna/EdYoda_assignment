1. Check the Replica set is correctly created and the pods are running or not

   -->kubectl get rs
   -->kubectl get pods

2. Once check the NodePort service is correctly created and exposed based on the service

   -->kubectl get svc

3. Check NodePort Configuration: Ensure that the NodePort is correctly configured in the service YAML. The NodePort should be within the range 30000-32767 unless you have customized it.

4. Check that the service selector matches the labels on the pods

5. Verify that the NodePort is correctly mapped to port 8000

6. Access the NodePort from outside the cluster using the correct IP address and port.

   -->http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
